"""M2-6 — Mechanical span-level citation verification (D-19). The milestone keystone.

For each claim the answer asserts, mechanically (no LLM) check that its cited span
overlaps an actually-retrieved chunk's char offsets on that chunk's page text. A
claim whose span does not overlap a real retrieved chunk is REJECTED before display
and surfaced explicitly (never silently dropped). Displayed filename + page are
chunk-derived (D-38) and the verified span's page offsets are returned.

Overlap criterion (deterministic): a claim is verified iff the NORMALIZED cited
span is a substring of the NORMALIZED text of the chunk the claim points to. Each
grounding chunk's ``text`` is exactly its page slice ``page_text[char_start:char_end]``,
so a substring match is, by construction, an overlap within [char_start, char_end];
the matched location is mapped back to raw offsets and reported as page offsets
(``char_start + local``). Normalization follows the M2-1/M2-2 contract — collapse
whitespace, de-wrap ``-\\n`` to ``-`` keeping the hyphen, drop quote characters,
lowercase — so PDF reflow does not cause a false reject.
