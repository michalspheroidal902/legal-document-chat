"""Task 3 — async ingest worker: turn an uploaded document into indexed, matter-scoped
chunks in the dedicated .lancedb_kb store, and drive the catalog status lifecycle.

extract (OCR-aware) -> chunk (offset-faithful, so span verification works) -> embed via
loopback bge-m3 -> append into .lancedb_kb (table 'chunks') scoped to the matter slug ->
set status ready / needs_review (any ocr_failed page) / failed (extraction error).
Idempotent: a doc's existing chunks are removed before re-adding, so re-ingest never
duplicates. Writes ONLY to .lancedb_kb — never an eval store.
